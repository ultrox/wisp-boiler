## Hi You,
This is very minimal stand alone example from wisp examples [routing](https://github.com/gleam-wisp/wisp/tree/main/examples/src/routing)

## Why?
1. I had some troubles finding proper new "start here"
2. I didn't know how to setup hot reloading so I did little `./run`

## Development
NOTE: you need to install `brew install watchexec`.
Tested on MacOS.

```sh
./run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
